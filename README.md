# üß™ Restful Booker API Testing (Postman Project)

This is a complete Postman collection designed to test the **Restful Booker API**. It covers **authentication**, **booking creation**, and all **CRUD operations** using real-world testing practices. This project demonstrates how to automate API testing flows and manage dynamic data with Postman environments and scripts.

---

## ‚úÖ Features Covered

- üîê **Token-based authentication** (using `/auth`)
- üìù **Create Booking** (with test script to save booking ID)
- üîç **Get All Bookings** and **Get by ID**
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Update Booking** (PUT)
- üß© **Partial Update Booking** (PATCH)
- üóëÔ∏è **Delete Booking**
- üí° **Health Check** (`/ping` endpoint)

---

## üìÇ Collection Highlights

- Uses **Postman environment variables** (`base_url`, `token`, `bookingId`)
- Applies **Postman test scripts** to:
  - Save token after auth
  - Save `bookingId` after creating a booking
- Sends authenticated requests using `Cookie: token={{token}}`
- Demonstrates **request chaining**, status validation, and dynamic workflows
